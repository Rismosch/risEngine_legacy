config: 
folder_root=path to root folder of folder structure
package=path to package location
lookup=path to sid lookup table

lookup_table:
sid=rispath // array of only these

// manager methods:
compile lookup // scans folder structure and generates lookup_table
decompile // extracts single files out of package. If lookup_table exists, create folder structure instead
compile folder // generates lookup_table, sorts it by sid, and then generates package from it and the folder_structure
get_file(sid) // get file with according sid,
		 in DEBUG, per default it looks up the path and retreives it from the folder structure,
		 in DEBUG, if flag is set to true, which is set upon construction, retreives it from the package instead,
		 in RELEASE, it will always retreive it from the package
